# Architecture Guide

All of the services use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Clean Architecture**, and **Event-Driven Design (EDD)** principles to structure a service. It is designed to be modular, testable, and highly scalable.

## üß† Architecture Overview

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

DDD is about structuring code around **business domains** and **domain logic**.

* **Entities** have identity and lifecycle.
* **Value Objects** are immutable and compared by value.
* **Aggregates** enforce consistency rules and business logic.
* **Domain Events** notify the system of important occurrences in the domain.

Example:

* `domain/aggregates/user.py` contains the User aggregate.
* `domain/value_objects/email.py` ensures valid email structure.
* `domain/events/user_created.py` represents a domain-level event.

---

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture enforces **layered separation of concerns**:

1. **Entities** ‚Üí Core domain logic (`domain/`)
2. **Use Cases** ‚Üí Application logic (`application/`)
3. **Interface Adapters** ‚Üí Input/output ports (`handlers/`, `repositories/`)
4. **Frameworks & Drivers** ‚Üí External concerns (`infrastructure/`)

> Core rule: **Dependencies always point inward**.

---

### Event-Driven Design

The system communicates through **events** to promote decoupling.

* `domain/events/` contains domain events.
* `shared/abstractions/events/` contains:

  * Event dispatcher
  * Handler base classes
  * Registry
* `shared/infrastructure/messaging/kafka_producer.py` handles publishing to Kafka.

Use this pattern to:

* Decouple services
* Enable async processing
* Achieve eventual consistency

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts

| Concept        | Location                                            | Description                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Aggregate Root | `domain/aggregates/user.py`                         | Enforces consistency and encapsulates business logic |
| Command        | `application/commands/create_user.py`               | Represents intent (e.g., create user)                |
| Handler        | `handlers/user_creation.py`                         | Executes command, triggers events                    |
| Event          | `domain/events/user_created.py`                     | Notification of domain change                        |
| Repository     | `infrastructure/repositories/user_repository.py`    | Accesses data source for aggregates                  |
| Kafka Producer | `shared/infrastructure/messaging/kafka_producer.py` | Sends events to message broker                       |
